# PStracker
A small basic webpage that tracks prices of games using Playstation Store Store API. 
Just add/remove the game U.P.S to the hasmhmap and everything else will be done automatically.

Looking for contributions in the following:
1. Price compare with Amazon, Best Buy and Gamestap using their APIs
2. A better UI
